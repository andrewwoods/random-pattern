# Random Pattern

__A fun project to demonstrate an idea__

This is where you write a paragraph or so, describing your project to the
person reading it, so they know what your project is all about. You could skip
this part.  However, after all the hard work you put into creating your
project, it would be a shame if nobody ever used it, because you didn't take
the time to explain it to them.  You don't have to write a lot - just enough to
get them interested.
